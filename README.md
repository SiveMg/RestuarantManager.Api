Restaurant Manager Api

This is the Api of the restaurant manager application.

To run the application you'll need to install dotnet the .net 6.0.102 sdk. 
If you have a different sdk, you can change the version in the global.json file.

The idea is to use clean architecture and CQRS, so keep that in mind when you add new files and projects
